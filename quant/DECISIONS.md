## 2026-08-20 — Freeze accounting boundary

- Treat quantity reconstruction as `EXACT` and use the analytical ledger for behavioral research.
- Keep exchange-reported `realisedPnl`, `execComm`, Funding, wallet history, and position snapshots in a separate reported ledger.
- Keep analytical cost, gross PnL, AEP, cycles, and confidence flags in a separate analytical ledger.
- Classify current-cost fidelity as `HIGH_CONFIDENCE_WITH_RESIDUAL`; do not add more global rounding brute force unless wallet reconciliation supplies direct evidence.
- Classify AEP fidelity as `HIGH_CONFIDENCE_WITH_ENGINE_SEMANTICS_UNRESOLVED`.
- Use `PASS` and `WARNING` valuation rows for downstream accounting; only `BLOCKED` rows are excluded.
- The dataset is `TRADE_RECORDS_ONLY`, so strategy fidelity is permanently reported as `BEHAVIORAL_APPROXIMATION`.
